      <h3>About OpenSIT</h3>
      <p><a href="https://community.sap.com/events/inside-track/about-inside-track" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Inside Tracks</a> are typically one day conferences, locally organised by passionate SAP community members, where knowledge and experience is being shared in talks or sessions. To make their conference content more broadly accessible, an increasing number of SAP Inside Tracks have started to live stream and record these sessions.</p>
      <p>The mission of OpenSIT is to make the session content recorded at SAP Inside Tracks easily accessible to SAP community members.</p>
      <p>All session recordings are currently hosted on YouTube and distributed across various channels. They are often hard to find and to discover. <a href="https://opensit.net">opensit.net</a> makes all SAP Inside Track session recordings accessible from this website. Available sessions are organised by SAP Inside Tracks and their annual conferences. Each SAP Inside Track page provides links to the respective Twitter hashtag, YouTube account and Twitter channel, if available. Each session page lists the session speakers and, if available, links to their <a href="https://community.sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Community</a> profiles or Twitter accounts.</p>
      <p>The SAP community has a strong presence on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/opensitnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@opensitnet</a> provides updates on new sessions or events available on <a href="https://opensit.net">opensit.net</a>, and promotes random session content to its followers. <a href="https://twitter.com/opensitnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@opensitnet</a> is also used to post updates about changes and enhancements to this website.</p>

      <h3>Streaming and recording SAP Inside Tracks</h3>
      <p>SAP Inside Track organisers have collaborated on a <a href="https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/events/SAP+Community+Events+Live+Streaming+How-To" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how-to document in SCN Wiki</a>, where the various setups and required equipments are being documented. OpenSIT of course supports the idea to make more sessions online accessible, that get recorded at the 40+ SAP Inside Tracks happening worldwide each year. Where possible, we help to share and improve the documentation of recording setups for all SAP Inside Track and their organisers.</p>

      <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
